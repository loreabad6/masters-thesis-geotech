# Geospatial Technologies Master's Thesis
Advances of my master thesis for the [Erasmus Mundus Masters in Geospatial Technologies](http://mastergeotech.info/).

__TOPIC:__ Validating a bike network analysis score based on open data as a connectivity measure of urban cycling infrastructure adapted for European cities.

* _Basic idea:_ Reproduce the [BNA score developed by People for Bikes](https://bna.peopleforbikes.org/#/), validate it and uadapt it to compute bike network connectivity in European cities.

* My thesis proposal can be accessed [here](https://loreabad6.github.io/masters-thesis-geotech/Thesis_Proposal.html). Keep in mind, it will be constantly updated.

* _First product:_ [BNA score translated into R and SQL, to be applied in European cities](https://loreabad6.github.io/masters-thesis-geotech/BNA-Europe.nb.html).

* _Second product:_ A [series of scripts] that come together into an [R-Markdown report] to calculate the BNA score for cities in England, Wales and the Netherlands. The analysis has been run for [Cambridge] as an example city.
