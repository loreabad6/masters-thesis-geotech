# Geospatial Technologies Master's Thesis
Advances of my master thesis for the [Erasmus Mundus Masters in Geospatial Technologies](http://mastergeotech.info/).

## Topic

Validating a bike network analysis score based on open data as a connectivity measure of urban cycling infrastructure adapted for European cities.

### Basic idea

Reproduce the [BNA score developed by People for Bikes](https://bna.peopleforbikes.org/#/), validate it and adapt it to compute bike network connectivity in European cities.
 
My thesis proposal can be accessed [here](https://loreabad6.github.io/masters-thesis-geotech/Thesis_Proposal.html). Keep in mind, it will be constantly updated.	

### Products

 * _First product:_ [BNA score translated into R and SQL, to be applied in European cities](https://loreabad6.github.io/masters-thesis-geotech/BNA-Europe.nb.html).
 
 * _Second product:_ A [series of scripts](scripts/) that come together into an [R-Markdown report](report/BNA-Report-Template.Rmd) to calculate the BNA score for cities in England, Wales and the Netherlands. The analysis has been run for some example cities:
    + [Cambridge, UK]()
    + [York, UK]()
    + [Oxford, UK]()
