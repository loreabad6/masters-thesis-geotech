Advances of my master thesis for the [Erasmus Mundus Masters in Geospatial Technologies](http://mastergeotech.info/).

__TOPIC:__ Optimizing connectivity of urban cycling infrastructure through a bike network analysis score based on open data

* Basic idea: Reproduce the [BNA score developed by People for Bikes](https://bna.peopleforbikes.org/#/), validate it and use it as a tool for bike network connectivity optimization.

* My thesis proposal can be accessed [here](https://loreabad6.github.io/masters-thesis-geotech/Thesis_Proposal.html). Keep in mind, it will be constantly updated.

* First steps: [BNA score translated into R and SQL, to be applied in European cities](https://loreabad6.github.io/masters-thesis-geotech/BNA-Europe.nb.html).
