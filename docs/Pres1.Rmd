## Research question

<span style="color:red; font-size:30pt; font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz';">Can a quantitative index based on open and/or crowdsourced data serve as a tool for urban planning of well-connected, low-stress cycling networks?
</span>

## Aim

Develop a methodology to optimize urban cycling networks' connectivity based on a quantitative index known as bike network analysis score.

## Objective 1

#### Improve the classification methodology previously developed for street segments (edges) and including also intersections (nodes) conforming the street network of a city into levels of traffic stress based on OpenStreetMap layers, tags, and additional ancillary data.

## First remark:

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(RPostgreSQL)

# LOAD POSTGRESQL DRIVER
driver <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
# CREATE CONNECTION TO THE POSTGRESQL DATABASE
# THE CONNECTION VARIABLE WILL BE USED FOR ALL FURTHER OPERATIONS
connection <- dbConnect(driver, dbname = "test_osm2pgsql",
                 host = "localhost", port = 5432,
                 user = getOption("database_userid"),
                 password = getOption("database_password"))

library(sf)
slope_ways <- st_read(
  dsn = connection,
  query = "SELECT * FROM generated.sa_ways_slope"
)
```

Slope data generated from DEM downloaded from [Mapzen](https://mapzen.com/) with the `elevatr` package.

Main concern: how to route according to a *climb* or *descent* scenario.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = slope_ways, aes(colour = slope)) + 
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = terrain.colors(10)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Slope (%)")
```

## Objective 2
]

#### Work upon the existing scoring technique which considers the ability of the low-stress bike network to reach core services within a certain biking distance, considering if possible work places.

## Second remark:

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(RPostgreSQL)

# LOAD POSTGRESQL DRIVER
driver <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
# CREATE CONNECTION TO THE POSTGRESQL DATABASE
# THE CONNECTION VARIABLE WILL BE USED FOR ALL FURTHER OPERATIONS
connection <- dbConnect(driver, dbname = "test_osm2pgsql",
                 host = "localhost", port = 5432,
                 user = "postgres", password = "das8410")

library(sf)
de_geostat <- st_read(
  dsn = connection,
  query = "SELECT tot_p, geom FROM geostat WHERE cntr_code = 'DE'"
) 

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(de_geostat, border = NA, main = "GEOSTAT population grid for Germany - 2011")
```

## Further Objectives

--
### Objective 3: 

--
#### Establish a methodology to reverse-engineer the process in a way that a desired score can be provided to obtain as a result low-stress network options for a city by introducing bike paths, bike lanes and zone 30 streets, as well as, bike signalling on conflictive intersections.

--
### Objective 4: 

--
#### Apply the methodology as case studies for cities in Europe with limited and/or partly developed bike infrastructure to evaluate the tool performance as a generally applicable methodology for any city and compare the different results.
