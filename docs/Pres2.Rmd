## What has happened so far?

--

.pull-left[

### Last presentation:

**Comment:** improve the research question

**To-do:** confirm the validation of the BNA score methodology
]

--
.pull-right[

### During these three weeks:

Talked to *People For Bikes* about BNA score

Discover there has not been scientific validation

Came up with a new research focus

#### New research question

.pull-left[
<span style="color:brown; font-size:30pt; font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz';"> *How accurately can a quantitative index based on open and/or crowdsourced data serve as a tool to evaluate connectivity of low-stress cycling networks?* </span>

## How I plan to do it?

## Breakdown of the BNA score

## **Hypothesis 1:** People bike more if there is a low stress network connecting their origin to their destination.

Find a relationship between areas connected by a low stress network and their number of bike trips.

## **Hypothesis 2:** People bike more to the highly ranked destinations according to the BNA score

This particular hypothesis is harder to test as the OD data I have for the UK is for Travel To Work. 

This means that other purpose trips would not be contemplated in the data.

#### Possible approaches: 
{{content}}

--
- Assume that this data is also valid for other trip purposes, and try to weight the results according to the [National Travel Survey](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/729521/national-travel-survey-2017.pdf) which gives regional (low spatial resolution) aggregates.

--
- Test this hypothesis on a study area where bike trip data, with precise origin and destinations are available:

## **Hypothesis 3:** "There is likely a relationship between connectivity and actual bicycling activity." (Lowry & Hadden, 2017)

Pearson correlation between BNA score and total number of bike trips for different cities in the UK.
